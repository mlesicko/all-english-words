english\_words.txt is a list of every word that has an English definition. This includes only words made up of alphabetic characters, apostrophes, and hyphens.

english\_game\_words.txt is a subset of english\_words.txt that I believe is suitable for playing word games. It excludes any words with characters outside the standard 26 English letters (e.g. "co√∂rdination", "mustn't", and "half-baked").
